## What I Do

I co-design with communities to reimagine care and restore dignity where "y'all" means all, online and off.

Rooted in Southern storytelling, digital strategy, and trust in community wisdom, I partner with folks creating futures where care is infrastructure and joy is part of the blueprint.

Every project starts with accessibility and ends with community, ensuring solutions hold what matters most.

**Focus Areas:**
- 🏥 Digital health innovation and community engagement
- ♿ Accessibility-first development and inclusive design
- 🧡 Trauma-informed, equitable technology solutions
- 🌱 Southern hospitality meets global thinking

## What I'm Designing

Systems that bridge gaps in care and empower communities through:
- **Digital Health Strategy** - Person-centered tools and frameworks
- **Accessibility Advocacy** - Making digital spaces open to everyone
- **Community Design** - Rooted in lived experience, local voices, and generational wisdom
- **[wilfredstephenanfield.com/](https://wilfredstephenanfield.com/)** - My digital porch where I try to practice what I preach about accessibility-first design. Built for all y'all. Feedback always welcome.

## Mason Jar Notes 🫙

> *On this porch, everyone's welcome. Y'all truly means all.  
> We listen, we share, we build community—one story, one solution, one thought at a time.*

I carry Southern roots and Mason jar values into every line of code, believing technology should serve and connect communities with care.
