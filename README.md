## What I Do

I co-design with communities to reimagine care and restore dignity where "y'all" means all, online and off.

Rooted in Southern storytelling, digital strategy, and trust in community wisdom, I partner with folks creating futures where care is infrastructure and joy is part of the blueprint.

Every project starts with accessibility and ends with community, ensuring solutions hold what matters most.

I also serve as a court-appointed legal guardian and conservator, a role that keeps me grounded in the realities of caregiving and care ethics, fiduciary responsibility, person-centered decision-making, and systemic accountability—reminding me that digital systems must serve folks with the same care I bring to court and community.

**Focus Areas:**

- 🏥 **Digital health innovation and community engagement** - co-designing tools and systems that make health access more human, equitable, and connected.
  
- ♿  **Accessibility-first development and inclusive design** - creating experiences that start with disability and elder justice, ensuring everyone can access and thrive in the digital world.
  
- 🧡 **Trauma-informed, equitable technology solutions** - bringing care ethics into tech, so every interaction supports dignity, healing, and trust.
  
- 🌱 **Southern hospitality meets global thinking** - infusing digital strategy with local wisdom, cultural responsiveness, and worldwide impact.
  
- 🏛️ **Guardianship and conservatorship-informed design** – translating lived experience from court-appointed care, fiduciary responsibility, and person-centered advocacy into systems that protect **_and_** empower.
  
- 💻 **Data dignity, digital consent, and data sovereignty** - advancing privacy, autonomy, and transparency in how communities' health and social data are governed and used.

## What I'm Designing

Systems that bridge gaps in care and empower communities through:
- **Digital Health Strategy** - Person-centered tools and frameworks
- **Accessibility Advocacy** - Making digital spaces open to everyone
- **Community Design** - Rooted in lived experience, local voices, and generational wisdom
- **[wilfredstephenanfield.com/](https://wilfredstephenanfield.com/)** - My digital porch where I try to practice what I preach about accessibility-first design. Built for all y'all. Feedback always welcome.

I carry **Southern roots** and **Mason jar values** into every line of code, believing technology should serve and connect communities with care.
