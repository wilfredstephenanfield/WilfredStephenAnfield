## What I Do

I craft **person-centered digital strategy** that connects health systems, communities, and equitable design. Blending Southern roots with systems thinking, I design inclusive solutions that center care and justice.

Every project starts with accessibility and ends with community, ensuring solutions hold what matters most.

**Focus Areas:**
- 🏥 Digital health innovation and community engagement
- ♿ Accessibility-first development and inclusive design
- 🧡 Trauma-informed, equitable technology solutions
- 🌱 Southern hospitality meets global thinking

## What I'm Designing

Systems that bridge gaps in care and empower communities through:
- **Digital Health Strategy** - Person-centered tools and frameworks
- **Accessibility Advocacy** - Making digital spaces open to everyone
- **Community Design** - Rooted in lived experience, local voices, and generational wisdom

## Porch Notes 🫙

> *"On the porch, everyone's welcome. Y'all truly means all.  
> We listen, we share, we build community—one story, one solution at a time."*

I carry Southern roots and Mason jar values into every line of code, believing technology should serve and connect communities.
